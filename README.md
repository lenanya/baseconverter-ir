# baseconverter in LLVM IR

this was just for fun, mainly to understand what actually happens to code when it gets compiled

uh yeah

if for any reason you want to build this:

- install clang
- run `make` (you might have to change the `target triple` in main.ll)

uh done

to use:

- `./main number base` where number >= 0 and is of type int 32 and 16 >= base >= 2 and is also int 32

why would you use this tho
